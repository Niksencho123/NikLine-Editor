# NikLine-Editor

# Version 0.1 BETA
Hello and welcome to one of my first official big python app.. A command-line editor. For now there are 10 commands you can use for text editing. To call a command you have to type a slash. If you don't the thing you wrote will be saved in the file. You can find all of the avaliable commands with /help. If you have any suggestion, you can write them! Also If you want to make changes, you can push. Have fun with the editor!
